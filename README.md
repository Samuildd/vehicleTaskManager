# Vehicle Task Manager

This project is a C# console based vehicle task manager. 

The vehicle task manager allows users to interact and manage a list of vehicles through the console interface.

Users are able to: Add Vehicles, Update Vehicles, View Vehicles, Remove Vehicles, Exit the application.

The Task Manager begins with no vehicles.

## How It Works (Program Flow)

* Performs the requested operation
* Asks if the user wants to continue
* Ends when the user enters exit or chooses not to continue
